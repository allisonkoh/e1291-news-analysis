# Leveraging Neural Networks for Political Ideology Classification of Online News Articles 

## Abstract 

In recent years, questions regarding the relationship between digital media and politics have been at the center of scholarly and public debates. Previous literature has established that word choice often reflects political ideology of individuals. We propose that textual cues and editorial decisions embedded to the online news media environment allow us to to classify the political position of news articles. Our modeling strategy builds on recent developments in the field of natural language processing. We apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify the political ideology of a random sample of *n=100,000* news articles from the U.S. of diverse political ideologies. Our proposed model achieves a *75.80* Macro-F1 score in classifying the political ideology of news articles.
